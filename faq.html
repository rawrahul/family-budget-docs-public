                    features risk-free!

                <h2>🔒 Security & Privacy</h2>

                <h3>Is my financial data safe?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely! We take security seriously:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Bank-level encryption (AES-256)</li>
                    <li>✅ Hosted on DigitalOcean (SOC 2 compliant)</li>
                    <li>✅ PostgreSQL database with encrypted backups</li>
                    <li>✅ We NEVER store your bank login credentials</li>
                    <li>✅ We NEVER sell your data to third parties</li>
                    <li>✅ GDPR compliant (EU/UK/global)</li>
                    <li>✅ All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Do you connect to my bank account?</h3>
                <p>No! You upload PDF/image statements manually. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ No security risk from bank API access</li>
                    <li>✅ Works with ANY bank worldwide</li>
                    <li>✅ You control what data you share</li>
                    <li>❌ Not automatic (but safer!)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What happens to my uploaded statements?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Sent to Google Gemini AI for transaction extraction (95%+ accuracy)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Original PDF is <strong>permanently deleted</strong> after processing
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Google's Guarantee:</strong> Google does NOT store or train on your data (paid API
                        guarantee)</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You can delete extracted transactions anytime</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="ai" class="doc-section">
                <h2>🤖 AI & Technology</h2>

                <h3>What AI do you use?</h3>
                <p>We use <strong>Google Gemini (Vision-First)</strong> for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement processing:</strong> "Sees" your PDF like a human (95%+ accuracy)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction categorization:</strong> Smart pattern learning</li>
                    <li><strong>Duplicate detection:</strong> Prevents double-counting</li>
                    <li><strong>Spending insights:</strong> Personalized budget recommendations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How accurate is the AI categorization?</h3>
                <p><strong>95%+ accuracy</strong> on standard bank statements. The AI learns from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transaction descriptions</li>
                    <li>Merchant names</li>
                    <li>Amount patterns</li>
                    <li>Your manual corrections (it gets smarter over time!)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Which banks/statements do you support?</h3>
                <p><strong>ANY bank</strong> that provides PDF or image statements! We've tested:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo (USA)</li>
                    <li>✅ Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, Monzo (UK)</li>
                    <li>✅ ICICI, HDFC, SBI (India)</li>
                    <li>✅ And 100+ more worldwide...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If it's a PDF/image with transactions, we can process it!</p>

                <h3>Do you support credit card statements?</h3>
                <p>Yes! We automatically detect credit card vs bank account statements and apply the correct accounting
                    logic. Credit card balances are treated as liabilities.</p>

                <h2>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Features</h2>

                <h3>How does family sharing work?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Invite family members via code generated by app when you create family</li>
                    <li>They create their account</li>
                    <li>You all see shared budgets</li>
                    <li>For premium family, each person can upload their own statements</li>

                <h3>Can I control what family members see?</h3>
                <p>No - and that's by design! The purpose of Family Budget is <strong>full financial
                        transparency</strong>. When you invite someone to your family:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They see ALL family accounts, transactions, and budgets</li>
                    <li>Everyone has the same view of family finances</li>
                    <li>This encourages open communication about money</li>
                    <li>Each member can still filter the dashboard by person to see individual spending</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="tip-box">
                    <strong>If you need privacy:</strong> Use Premium Solo instead. Family Budget is for families who
                    want complete transparency.
                </div>

                <h3>What if I want to remove a family member?</h3>
                <p>Family members can remove themselves from family. Family owner can remove family members from family
                    settings. Their transactions, accounts, budgets, goals, and settings stay with them.</p>
